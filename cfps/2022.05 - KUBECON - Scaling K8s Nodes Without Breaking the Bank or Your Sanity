# Scaling K8s Nodes Without Breaking the Bank or Your Sanity

## Conference
KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU (Spain)

## Abstract
Kubernetes (k8s) has enabled applications to be mostly agnostic to the underlying VM infrastructure it is running on. 
Many clusters can benefit from the cost savings of utilizing spare VM capacity offerings commonly called Spot. 
In this session, we will discuss some of the best practices for utilizing spot capacity within a k8s cluster and 
some of the tools that will make your life easier managing the underlying VM infrastructure.

## Describe audience
Engineers who want to lower node costs by learning spot best practices.

## Why this talk
Everyone wants k8s cluster infrastructure to cost less and be easier to manage. 
This talk dives into using spot nodes to drastically reduce cluster costs and 
using Karpenter to reduce node group infrastructure.
